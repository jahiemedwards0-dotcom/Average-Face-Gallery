      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        A regional variant within the broader Mexico and Central America–Mestizo
        complex. It developed in the ranching–mining belt of northwest and
        north-central Mexico through long-term Spanish–Indigenous admixture.
      </p>

      <h3>Traits</h3>

        <li>Skin light- to medium-brown, tanning deeply; stature average to tall with a compact, stockier build.</li>
        <li>Faces often rounder in men and slightly longer in women; mild neoteny (soft, baby-faced look) is common.</li>
        <li>Nose medium and usually projecting; lips full.</li>
        <li>Eyes predominantly dark and slightly upturned; lighter shades appear in a minority; occasional epicanthic folds.</li>

      On average, their skin falls in a medium to deep brown range. The face is
      short and broad, with a big, strong jaw. The nose is medium in length but
      wide, with a round and sometimes bulbous tip. The lips are very full,
      especially the lower lip, and the brow and midface are slightly prominent.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hair is usually black and coily to tightly curled, though some people have
      looser curls or a reddish-brown tone, and a small minority naturally have
      lighter or blondish hair. The eyes are large and almond-shaped, almost
      always dark brown to nearly black. A faint epicanthic fold can also appear in some individuals.
      Body hair is abundant, and they are 
      typically very robust and tall.

      Lithuanians typically have pale to light beige skin with a cool, sometimes pinkish undertone. 
      Faces tend to be fairly broad and compact, with cheekbones reading as the widest point 
      and the jaw tapering cleanly toward the chin. The nose is most often straight to slightly convex 
      with clear forward projection.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hair is usually dark blond to light or medium brown, often ash-toned, and eyes are most commonly 
      blue, grey, or green, with brown less frequent. Genetically, Lithuanians form a tight Baltic cluster 
      with high steppe-derived ancestry mixed with older Baltic hunter-gatherer and early-farmer layers.

      This average represents colonial-era mulato Brazilians: populations formed
      largely from African-descended women and European-descended men, sometimes
      with additional Indigenous ancestry. Historically they were concentrated in
      the North and Northeast and along major coastal towns and cities.
    </p>
    <p>
      On average, skin tones range from light brown to medium-dark brown, often
      with warm golden or slightly reddish undertones. Faces are usually oval to
      slightly long, with visible but not extreme cheekbones and a tapered jaw.
      The nose tends to be medium in width with a straight to slightly convex
      bridge and a rounded, fleshy tip. Lips are medium to full.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hair is typically dark brown to black and wavy to curly, though tighter
      coils also occur. Eyes are mostly dark brown, with some light-brown or
      hazel examples. As with any mixed population, there is a wide range of
      individual variation around this average.

        Mississipid is an African American phenotype that developed in the
        plantation South of the United States. From the Deep South, this pattern
        spread into the Great Lakes region, the East Coast corridor, and the West
        Coast during the Great Migration. It is one of the most common phenotypic
        patterns among African Americans today, especially in urban centers,
        church-based communities, and multi-generation Southern families.

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>
        Chesapeakid is a Black / African American phenotype that developed in the
        Chesapeake Bay region during the slave era. It grew out of one of the
        earliest and longest-lasting free people of color communities in the
        United States. Before Jim Crow
        and the one-drop rule, many people in this group were legally and socially
        classified as “mulatto” and stood out as distinct from both Black and
        white populations.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the twentieth-century Great Migration, Black migrants from the
        Deep South moved into Mid-Atlantic and industrial Northern cities. As a
        result, older Chesapeakid lineages now overlap and blend with Mississippid
        types in places such as Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington, D.C., and
        parts of the Great Lakes region. A similar phenotypic pattern can also
        appear among mixed-race Louisiana Creoles and other long-mixed families
        in the United States.
      </p>

      <h3>Traits</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Faces medium in size and softly oval.</li>
        <li>Noses usually medium-wide, with a straight to slightly convex bridge, a rounded tip, and mild nostril flare.</li>
        <li>Lips very full; jawline tends to be rounder or squarer than in Mississippid types.</li>
        <li>Eyes almond-shaped and predominantly dark brown, with occasional light-brown or hazel shades.</li>
        <li>Skin ranges from light brown to dark brown, usually with warm or golden undertones; freckles sometimes appear.</li>
        <li>Hair curly to tightly coily, typically ranging from 3A to 4C; body hair moderate to heavy.</li>

        The head is mainly rounded, with a short, very broad, relatively flat face
        and prominent cheekbones. The skin is light to medium yellow-brown; very
        dark complexions are rare. Hair is usually black, with dark to medium brown
        also seen; it is straight and coarse, and beard or body hair is sparse.
        Eyes are mostly dark brown to nearly black, though medium brown and
        occasional hazel-like tones also appear.
      </p>
      <p>
        The eyes are slightly up-slanted, and monolids or low creases are common.
        The nose is short to medium, usually straight to slightly concave, sometimes
        with a somewhat higher bridge or small convexity.
